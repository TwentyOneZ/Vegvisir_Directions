# Vegvisir_Directions
Valheim Mod that changes the way Vegvisirs works. Now they will point at the direction of the altar it is supposed to reveal.
There are some options such as turn the camera to the direction, give precise angle to the altar, mark the location on the map and Localization, all in the config file.
